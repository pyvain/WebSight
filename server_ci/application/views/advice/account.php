    This website is known to function with a system of account.
    Maybe a first step to identify the data leak is to <a href=<?=$account_url?>>connect to your account</a> if you have one and check your confidentiality settings.
    <br>
    If you don't use this account, you may want to <a href=<?=$delete_url?>>delete or deactivate</a> it.
